### What is this?

A Super Hexagon Clone for the Nintendo 3DS. This should run on both o3ds, n3ds, and Citra homebrew environments. The Makefile also creates a CFW compatible CIA too, for those who are into that kind of stuff. A banner is included.

### Notes

This game uses a software rendering function. This could probably be redone using the GPU but whatever.
